Today we release an FAQ Chatbot that answers [COVID19 Virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019) related questions. All information we used to train the bot is obtained from [Health Promotion Bureau of Sri Lanka](http://healthpromo.gov.lk/covid-19).

To develop this chatbot, we used [BuddhiNLP](https://www.buddhilive.com/2021/01/how-to-build-chatbot-with-javascript.html)Â Chatbot Framework, which is an open-source chatbot framework for JavaScript.

We will keep updating the brain of chatbot to help people to find relevant information on COVID19 instantaneously.
