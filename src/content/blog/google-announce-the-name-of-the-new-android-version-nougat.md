In a recent video posted on the Android YouTube channel Google announced the name of the new generation of Android 7.0: the Nougat. The nougat is made with honey, egg whites and almonds; in some places in the world it also gets a chocolate covering.

  

Among the new features offered by Nougat is support multi-windows, notifications, direct response and clustered mode, as well as improvements in Twelve feature (which prolongs battery life).

  

In addition, it features improvements in gaming APIs and will introduce virtual reality platform Google Daydream, in certified devices.

  

To celebrate the arrival of the new version of the mobile platform, a new statue has been installed at the Google campus in Mountain View.
