Platform as a Service provides cloud based runtime environment for applications which offers tools for development and deployment that are required to develop applications. Some PaaS vendors provide point-and-click tools for non developers to develop web applications too.  
  
PaaS vendors provide build-in APIs for developers to use. Applications that are hosted on PaaS can be accessed form any where anytime. All you need is a PC and Internet connection. Applications on cloud can be scaled to fit the number of users without doing any change to the application. This simplifies the burdon that should behandled by a developer.
