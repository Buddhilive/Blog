Google launched a new feature in Google Translate for Android to perform translations within any application that is in use without leaving the app. This feature is known as "Tap to Translate".

  

All you have to do is just highlight the text in other language, then the Google Translate icon will appear. Click on it, you'll get the translation in a popup window. So now you don't need to leave the WhatsApp, Telegram, Hangouts or any other app to translate.

  

This feature is available offline too. To use this feature offline, you'll need to download a translate file of 25MB of size for each language you need to translate.

  

Watch the following video to learn how to use "Tap to Translate":
