The Universal Brand Development , the Amblin Entertainment and Ludia have teamed up with Google Search to bring "life" to 10 dinosaurs of "Jurassic World" with the help of Augmented Reality (AR).

  

> "Now, the giant T. Rex can enter your living room, with his heavy paws, and the majestic Brachiosaurus can walk among the trees in your neighborhood," said Google.

  

Just type the name of a dinosaur in Google Search using your mobile device, and then click on “**View in 3D**” to rotate or zoom in on the image and see all the details. Then, you can bring the dinosaur into the house using Augmented Reality and adjust the size of the animal - so you can understand the size of these giants in relation to the objects around them. On Android devices, you can increase the volume, hear the sound of footsteps and dinosaurs.

The 10 dinosaurs of "Jurassic World" that can be viewed through AR are the Tyrannosaurus Rex, the Velociraptor, the Triceratops, the Spinosaurus, the Stegosaurus, the Brachiosaurus, the Ankylosaurus, the Dilophosaurus, the Pteranodon and the Parasaurolophus.

  

The models used in Google Search use the [same technology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhePrheDiuc&feature=youtu.be) of the game “Jurassic World Alive”, by Ludia, to represent the most realistic dinosaur in AR. Unlike other Google AR animals, like a dog or a penguin, dinosaurs impose a new technical challenge: their gigantic size! Android's new automatic scale feature is able to calculate the distance between the user's phone and a surface around it, then automatically resize the dinosaur to fit on the device's screen accordingly.
