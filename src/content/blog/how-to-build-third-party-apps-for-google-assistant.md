As I mentioned in my [previous article](http://www.buddhilive.com/2019/05/build-apps-for-google-assistant-with-actions-on-google.html), you can build third party apps for Google Assistant. This is known as "Actions on Google". So you may be wondering how to build an app for Google Assistant or how to create an Action on Google. So I decided to share the best beginner guide that you can follow to learn how to build an Action on Google.

This is a tutorial series with 3 levels. Actually this is the official Codelab from Google that gives you a perfect hands-on coding experience in the process of building Actions on Google. I highly recommend to follow this 3 Codelabs if you are new to Actions on Google Development.

### [Build Actions for the Assistant (Level 1)](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/actions-1/#0)

In this Codelab you will be able to learn following things;

- Understand how Actions work.
- How to create a project in the Actions Console.
- How to create a Dialogflow agent.
- How to define training phrases in Dialogflow.
- How to test your Action in the Actions Console Simulator.
- How to use Dialogflow slot-filling and system entities.
- How to implement Action fulfillment using the Action on Google client library and the Dialogflow inline editor.

  

### [Build Actions for the Assistant (Level 2)](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/actions-2/#0)

In this Codelab you can master following skills;

- How to develop your fulfillment locally using the Node.js client library.
- How to deploy Actions using the Firebase command-line.
- How to create deep links.
- How to use helper intents.
- How to add Dialogflow custom entities.
- How to create sound effects with SSML.
- How to add Dialogflow follow-up intents with contexts.
- How to create rich responses (basic cards).
- How to store session data.

### [Build Actions for the Google Assistant (Level 3)](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/actions-3/#0)

This Codelab is designed to teach you following skills;

- How to create sample dialogs when designing conversational Actions.
- How to personalize user greetings on subsequent visits using cross-conversation storage.
- How to gracefully handle user silence and cancellations.
- How to design your Action for multiple surfaces so that it sends users a rich visual response (namely, a carousel) if users are on devices with supported screens and sends a basic card response to voice-only surfaces.
- How to handle a user's selection from the list of options displayed to them through the carousel.

After going through these Codelabs, you can get the basic knowledge and skills you need to have as an Actions on Google Developer (or AoGDev). Go through the Codelabs
