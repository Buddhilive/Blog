In celebration of the arrival of 4th installment of Avengers movie series "The Avengers: Endgame" in cinemas around the world, Google has launched an easter egg on its search results that allows to turn the search results into ashes.

  

As you all know [Thanos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanos) used his Infinty Gaunlet and snap his fingers wiping out the half of the population in the universe. Similarly you can wipe out half of the search results on Google Search using Thanos' Infinity Gauntlet.

  

All you have to do is type "Thanos" in Google Search and press enter to visit the search result page. You can find an Infinity Gaunlet in the knowledge graph of the search results page. Just click (or tap in a mobile) and wait. The gaunlet will snap and you can see half of the search results starts disapearing. The animations and sound effects are same as the movie. You can see the search result count is reducing to half.

  

Click on the Infinity Gaunlet again. It will use the Time Stone to undo the wiping out of the search results and will restore everything back to normal. You can see the count of search results getting back to normal.

  

Watch the video below to see how it works and don't hesitate to give it a try. Also you may be interested to see many other [hidden games on Google Search and other products of Google here](https://www.buddhilive.com/2016/12/what-are-hidden-games-on-google-search.html).
