Google announced "Spaces", a new application that comes for Android and iOS and allows you to share articles, videos and images more simply, without the need to switch between apps.

  

Focusing on preventing the user has to copy and paste to share content, Spaces integrates Google Search, YouTube and Chrome to facilitate the process, and an integrated search.

  

But Google did not explain how the Spaces will work with Hangouts and Google+, or have some integration with private [chats that begin to arrive within the YouTube app](http://www.buddhilive.com/2016/05/google-introduce-new-chat-feature-to.html).
