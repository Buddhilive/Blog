Google Cloud Platform introduce a new user interface (UI) that aims to simplify Cloud Load Balancing configuration.

  

“You’ll now be able to configure all Cloud Load Balancing flavors through a unified interface.This UI is also designed to seamlessly accommodate new load balancing features that are expected to land in 2016 and beyond, and deliver a simpler, more intuitive user experience” says Prajakta Joshi, Product Manager, Google Cloud Platform.

  

Google Cloud Load Balancing comes in multiple flavors — HTTP(S), TCP, SSL(TLS) and UDP. With the new UI, you can easily do configurations by selecting the flavor of traffic you want to load balance.
