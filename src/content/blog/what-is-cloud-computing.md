Cloud computing means "on demand delivery of IT resources via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing to store, manage, and process data." Therefore Cloud Computing is also known as 'on-demand computing'.  
  
Many IT companies need to maintain a server room which consists database server, mail server, networking, firewalls, routers, modem, switches etc. To implement and maintain such a server room is very expensive and burdonsome. So cloud computing is the modern solution for this problem.  
  

### Why Cloud?

Cloud computing is a model for on-demand access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources. Since all these resources are highly available and more reliable, issues like infrastructure failures are very rare. Cloud Computing allows multiple users and applications work more efficiently with low cost. That means instead of buying license and software for each and every computer, you just need to run one application on your cloud server. So if the company expands, you don't need to buy new license.

Cloud Computing enables users to access the system regardless their location or the device they use. The only thing they need is a device with web browser and a internet connection.  
  
Since Cloud computing is Pay-as-per-usage model, you only need to pay for what you use. Think is you need more storage, so only you have to do is pay for the extra storage, and the extra storage will be availble on demand. So it very easy to manage and configure your system with Cloud Computing.  
  
Cloud computing can handle large workloads like huge datacenters. So the cost that a company have to bare to maintain such a infrastructure is saved. With less effort and low cost, a company can own a server that can handle heavy work load easily and automatically.
