I suggest "[Google Pixel](https://madeby.google.com/phone/)" as the best alternative for iPhone 7. Why? Here's the reasons;

  

  

- **The first phone with the [Google Assistant](http://www.buddhilive.com/2016/10/google-assistant-will-be-available-for.html) built in**. Google Assistant is the virtual assitant develop by Google. So Google Assitant is the alternative AI for Apple's Siri.

- **The highest rated smartphone camera ever**. This is the most exciting feature available on Google Pixel. Pixel's camera is 12.3MP and has a f/2.0 aperture. It also provides accurate and very good contrast and fast autofocus, enabling you to take brilliant photos in low light, bright light or any light.

- **Unlimited storage for all your photos and videos**. You get unlimited storage from Google Drive. So say goodbye to “storage is full” notifications.

- A seamless glass-aluminum body with smooth surface sand easy-to-grip curved edges.

- Unlock your phone quickly, and swipe down on the fingerprint sensor for quick access to all your notifications.
