Artificial Intelligence has gain popularity these days. AI can be found in many products that we use today. News recommendations, product recommendations on online stores, voice assistants like Google Assistants, chatbots etc. AI has influenced many industries like healthcare, banking, manufacturing, cyber security, music and arts and so on. With the term Artificial Intelligence, there are some terms associated with, namely Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Neural Networks. Are these terms refers to the same thing? or they have separate meanings? Let's check it out.

  

Actually AI, ML, DL and Neural Networks are closely related to each other, but have different roles. To understand this, take a look at below diagram. This diagram describe the difference as well as the relationship with those terms. Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence. Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning. Let's try to understand this with their functionality.

## Artificial Intelligence

We all know computers work according to a set of commands given by humans. Computers can't work without humans, or can they? Artificial Intelligence have many definitions. But simply it means, ability of computers or machines to think and make their own decisions without human intervention. It is basically mimicking human behavior. Usually this idea looks scary because it has been socialized as the end of human civilization by many Sci-fi movies. But it's not. And... yeah it can be. But we haven't reach that level yet. So don't worry.

  

## Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a set of techniques and algorithms which trains computers or machines to perform a particular task without being explicitly programmed. We'll discuss this deeply in a future post.

## Deep Learning

Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning which is inspired by how human brain works. Deep Learning is consist of multiple layers of Neural Networks. Neural Networks are the integral part of Deep Learning. In most occasions Deep Learning and Machine Learning terms are used interchangeably.

  

### Neural Networks

As we mentioned earlier, deep learning is consist of multiple neural networks. Neural Networks helps to filter the data we feed and do predictions or classifications. As this technique is inspired by how biological neurons work (not exactly as that) it is known as Neural Networks. We can think this as the neurons of computers.

  

Well this is a very brief introduction to Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning. There are lot more things to learn about them. We'll discuss each of these technologies separately and then we'll learn how to use them. So stay tuned.
