Google Cloud Platform annouced that they are now officially an IBM eligible Public Cloud. That means you can run a wide range of IBM software SKUs on Google Compute Engine ([IaaS platfrom](http://www.buddhilive.com/2016/01/what-is-infrastructure-as-service-iaas.html) of Google Cloud) with your existing license.

  

Further, Chuck Coulson, the Head of Global Technology Partner Programs, invites cutomers to give suggestions to make IBM software optimized for Compute Engine. You can **[take this simple survey](https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/forms/d/1dK9JxdLa3kgFXJFqwu17D4EscvfNHWiyDeh4k0C8qaw/viewform?edit_requested=true)** and help Google Cloud Platform team to identify how the IBM software should be packaged, tuned and optimized for Compute Engine. If you like, you are free to contact Chuck Coulson via email (ccoulson@google.com) for any other questions and suggestions.
