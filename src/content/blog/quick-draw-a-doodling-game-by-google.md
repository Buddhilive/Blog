Google Creative Lab and Data Arts Team have built a game calle "Quick Draw" with machine learning as a part of [Google's AI Experiment](https://aiexperiments.withgoogle.com/quick-draw). It's just a simple but a fun game. When you enter in to the game, the game ask the player to draw a sketch within 20 seconds using mouse or touchscreen. While you are doodling, the Google Neural Network tries to guess what you are drawing. If Google AI identify your sketch before the given time ends, it stops and you will be directed to the next sketch.

  

Sometimes Google AI won't understand, but more you play, more it will learn. It's a good game to play when you are bored.
