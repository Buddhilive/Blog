Google announced that they intend to face the Facebook and Periscope to add a live streaming option directly in the YouTube app for Android and iOS.  
  
The Search giant highlights its infrastructure as a differentiator when compared to competing services, in addition to having all the features and recommendations that users already know.  
  
"Since using the unmatched YouTube infrastructure will be faster and more reliable than anything else out there," says the company.
