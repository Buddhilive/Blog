Finally [Google](https://plus.google.com/116899029375914044550) has decided to replace [Oracle](https://plus.google.com/115607918987921226255) 's Java API with OpenJDK API on the new Android 'N' version. Google has taken this decision because of the [dispute related to Oracle's copyright and patent claims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_America,_Inc._v._Google,_Inc.) on Java API used in Google's Android operating system. Google is going to use [OpenJDK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenJDK) in the new Android 'N' version. OpenJDK is also an alternative Java API still owned by Oracle. OpenJDK (Open Java Development Kit) is a free and open source version of JDK (Java Development Kit)  
  
But it's better if Google can implement their own language Go on [Android](https://plus.google.com/104629412415657030658). Go Language is also becoming very popular. It is among the top 20 programming languages and it is also a very successful language which is implemented by Google in their web applications too. ([Read more about Go Language here.](http://www.buddhilive.com/2015/07/go-language-and-its-future.html)) They can improve Go Language to be used on Android. So they have their own language for developing in their Mobile OS similar to Apple's Swift Language.
