Love Harry Potter? Do you know you can cast some Harry Potter spells to control some actions in Google Assistant? Yes! There are some spells from Harry Potter fantasy which can be used to control certain actions in Google Assistant. Here are the spells;

- **"Lomos Maxima"** or **"Lumos"**: Turns on the flashlight.
- **"Nox"**: Turns off the flashlight.
- **"Silencio"**: Mute ringing volume.

Try those spells on your Google Assistant. Don't forget to cast the killing curse **"Avada Kadavra"** too. See what happens.
