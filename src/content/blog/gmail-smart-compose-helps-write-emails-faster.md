Gmail Smart Compose feature is developed with artificial intelligence aiming to help you create emails from scratch, faster.

  

From your greeting to its closing (and common phrases in the middle), Smart Compose suggests complete sentences to compose a message. (Cool! huh?)

  

Smart Compose will offer suggestions as you type. When you see a suggestion you like, just click the "tab" button to use it.

  

"Smart Compose helps save time by reducing repetitive writing, reducing the chance of spelling and grammatical errors. You can even suggest relevant contextual sentences. For example, if it's Friday, you can suggest 'Have a great weekend!' as a final phrase, "says Google.

  

The feature will be available soon. Now you can reply emails faster than ever before!
