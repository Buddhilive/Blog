Boston Dynamics, a company specialized in robotics and also a subsidiary of Alphabet / Google, introduced SpotMini, a giraffe like robot able to pass under objects and take care of some household activities.

  

The SpotMini is able to climb flights of stairs, put dirty glasses in the dishwasher and throw an empty soda can in the trash. "It has a variety of sensors, including depth cameras, gyroscope solid (IMU) and proprioception sensors in the limbs, These sensors help with navigation and mobile manipulation. SpotMini performs some tasks independently, but often uses a human being for guidance." a spokesman said.

  

Recent rumors suggest that Toyota Research Institute is trying to acquire the Boston Dynamics. For now, representatives of Google and Toyota deny any agreement.
