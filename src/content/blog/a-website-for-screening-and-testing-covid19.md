Verily, a health tech company owned by Alphabet, has build a tool that will monitor the status of the Coronavirus in the U.S.

  

The website screen people who think they might have COVID19 and then direct them to verified testing sites. A spokesman at Verily said â€œWe are in the early stages of development and plan to launch tests in the bay area, with the hope of expanding more widely over time. We appreciate the support of government officials and industry partners and we thank the Google engineers who volunteered to be part of this effort."
