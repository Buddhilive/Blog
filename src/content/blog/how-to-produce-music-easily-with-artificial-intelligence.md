### Getting Started

Visit [BL Studio](https://studio.buddhilive.com/) and enter your desired [Chord Progression](https://www.buddhilive.com/p/chord-progressions.html) after BL Studio initialized. Click proceed and follow instructions given in each step. At Step 03 you may have wait a little bit as the generating of music take sometime. At the end you can download the generated music clip as a MIDI file.

  

You can open this MIDI file in your favorite [Digital Audio Workstation (DAW)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation) and add your creativity by editing pitches, changing instruments etc. I use [Cakewalk by Bandlab](https://www.bandlab.com/products/cakewalk) which is a Free but powerful DAW. You can use your own favorite DAW.
