Google [Chromebooks](http://www.google.com/chromebook/) sales in the US exceeded sales of Apple Macbooks in terms of shipping for the first time. Estimates suggest that more than 2 million Chromebooks were sold during the first quarter of this year while compared to 1.7 million Macbooks.

  

To keep this growth in hot, Google unveiled bold plans during the [conference for developers Google I / O 2016](http://www.buddhilive.com/2016/05/google-io-2016-in-nutshell.html) in which will make Android applications compatible with Chrome OS. This will create a competition in-between Windows PCs too.

  

Recently [Google](https://plus.google.com/116899029375914044550) released [Chromebook 13, which is thinner than Macbook Air](http://www.buddhilive.com/2016/04/chromebook-13-is-thinner-than-macbook.html). We can expect high-end Chromebooks later in this year. Finally, welcome to the year of Linux!
