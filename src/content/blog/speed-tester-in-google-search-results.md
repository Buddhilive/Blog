Google is testing a new feature in their search engine that allows you to measure the speed of the internet with just one search.

  

It is still available for US only and this feature can be accessed with the term "check internet speed" in Google.

  

If you can't wait for Google Speed Tester avaible for your region, you are able to measure the speed of your internet via Google Fiber speed test at [this link](http://speedtest.googlefiber.net/).
