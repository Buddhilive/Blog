There's rumor that the search giant Google will release their new Searching Algorithm, Penguin 4.0 by the end of this year (2015). It is expected to be a real time algorithm, which means that the algorithm will keep updating continuesly.  
  
The new algorithm is design to detect spam links in a site. Only sites with quality links will rank up in search results. So you may expect some changes in ranking in Google search results by the end of this year.  
  
Let's keep waiting tosee what more features will come out with the Google's Penguine 4.0 update.
