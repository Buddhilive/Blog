Google added a new feature to Google Maps that shows if a location has accessibility entrance to help people who use wheelchairs. This project was initiated by Rio Akasaka and his team. At Google, employers are allowed to spend 20% of their timeÂ on things that donâ€™t pertain to their normal jobs and Rio and his team came with this brilliant idea during this period.

  

Information about accessibility for wheelchairs can be obtained from the details of the location that describe some of its details, such as offers, types of environments, opening hours etc. Google Local Guides can contribute for this project since it is very helpful for people who use wheel chairs. So if you are a Local Guide, please be kind to contribute on this project during your free time. ðŸ˜‰
