In [previous lesson,](https://www.buddhilive.com/2020/04/moving-camera-with-player-gdevelop.html) we learned to set camera to follow the player. In this lesson we are going to learn how to create Jump Through Platforms.  You may have seen in platformer games, there are small platforms where player can jump through them and land on them. Those are the jump through platforms. Let’s add jump through platforms to our game.

### Step 1

Add a new sprite object and name it “JumpThrough”. (we learned how to add objects in a previous lesson). Add “_JumpThrough.png”_ from _assets > platform_. Drag and drop the object on to the canvas.

### Step 2

Now we need to add behavior to this object to make it a jump through platform. Go to _Edit object_ and switch to behavior tab. Click **ADD A BEHAVIOR TO THE OBJECT** and choose “**Platform**” from the popup. Select “_Jumpthru Platform”_ as the **Type** from the drop down menu and click **APPLY** to save the changes.

That’s all. Now hit **Preview** button and try jumping through to the Jump through platform we created.

In the [next lesson](https://www.buddhilive.com/2020/05/adding-background-objects-to-game.html), we are going to improve the environment of the game.
