Google Glass is a futuristic technology that promises to revolutionize how we use our devices to interact with the world. But from a developer’s standpoint, what is so special about developing for the glass? The answer is “Nothing!” In fact, from the perspective of an experienced Android developer, Google Glass is just another Android device with a very small screen and limited features!

  

The fact that anyone with Android development knowledge can become a member of this “elite” community of futuristic wearable-tech evangelists is part of what makes Google Glass so awesome. Sure, you will need to learn a few new things, such as the difference between “Immersion” and “Active Card”, but as you will see, the learning curve is not steep.
