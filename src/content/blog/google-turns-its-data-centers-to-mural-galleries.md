You know data centers are really boring places. Google, which owns number of large data centers around the globe, has decided to make this boring places really interesting places. So Google announced a new project named " [Data Center Mural Project](https://datacentermurals.withgoogle.com/) " that aims to transform their data centers into giant art projects.

  

The action also has the intention to the "beautification" of these data centers, known for its gray and lifeless color. "Because these buildings typically aren’t much to look at, people usually don’t, and rarely learn about the incredible structures and people who make so much of modern life possible," said Joe Kava, the VP of Google's data centers.

  

The projet is already in Oklahoma and Belgium data centers. Google hopes o expand this project to 11 of its data centers around the world. Watch these interesting videos on "Data Center Mural Project".
