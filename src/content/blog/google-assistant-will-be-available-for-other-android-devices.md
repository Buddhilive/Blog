Google introduce "Google Pixel", a smartphone made by Google on 4th October, 2016 at [Google Hardware Event](http://www.buddhilive.com/2016/10/made-by-google-google-hardware-event.html). With Google Pixel [Google Assistant](http://www.buddhilive.com/2016/05/google-assistant-virtual-assistant-with.html) (the AI introduced by Google) has been launched as an exclusive feature.

  

And now Google is planning to make Google Assitant widely available to all Android users. The company also stated that other unique features unveiled with Pixel, like Pixel Launcher and Camera application will be open for the rest of the Android community.

  

To compete with Apple's Siri and Microsoft's Cortana, Google Assistant requires widespread adoption by users and limiting the service to a single device won't give Google Assistant a chance. So in the near future, Google Assistant would be available for other Android devices.
