"[Material Design](https://material.google.com/)" was announced at the Google I/O Conference held in 2014. Now Material Design has become the main theme of almost all Google Applications. The ultimate goal of inventing Material Design is to create a visual language that synthesizes classic principles of good design with the innovation and possibility of technology and science.

  

Before Google use Material Design on Google+, it took much time to load in some occasions. After adopting Material Design, Google+ became very faster as never before. When I experience this difference, I really got amazed and finally became a fan of Material Design. Now Material Design is widely used by many developers in their apps.

  

[AngularJS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AngularJS) is a popular JavaScript MVW Framework invented by Google. It addresses many of the challenges encountered in developing single-page applications (SPA). Google is developing a special Material Design library for AngularJS called "[Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/)" enabling AngularJS programmers to use Material Design in their applications. Angular Material is also gaining popularity these days. So I hope to share a good article about Angular Material written by "Matt Spaulding", a JavaScript Developer. It is a great article for anyone who likes to learn Angular Material. Enjoy the post;
