Google announced today that Google Calendar application will receive a new feature that will set goals and remind you of them.

  

"Goals require hard work. If you want to read more books, learning a new language or work out regularly, it's getting increasingly difficult to find the time, even when your goal really matters to you, "said a Google spokesman. 

  

"So today we're introducing targets on Google Calendar. You can add a personal goal to "run 3 times a week" and the Calendar will schedule the time automatically, and then help you actually stick to it. " If something unexpected interrupt your training, Calendar uses machine learning to adjust and automatically reschedule the event without harming the goals.
