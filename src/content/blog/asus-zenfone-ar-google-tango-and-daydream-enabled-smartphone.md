ASUS revels details about their new samrtphone "ASAS ZenFone AR" during their press conference tomorrow (4th January 2017). However, Qualcomm has revealed some features of ASUS ZenFone AR, because ASUS ZenFone AR use the same Qualcomm processor used in Google Pixel, i.e. Qualcomm Snapdragon 821.

  

The most interesting thing about ASUS ZenFone AR is, it will be the second smartphone comes with [Google Tango](https://get.google.com/tango/) enabled. (Note: The first Google Tango enabled smartphone is Â Lenovo Phab 2 Pro) Not only that, it will be the first smartphone that comes with both Google Tango and Google Daydream enabled.

  

However Qualcomm haven't mention anything about screen, memory or storage of the device. So we have to wait until ASUS officially reveal the full technical specification of ASUS ZenFone AR.
