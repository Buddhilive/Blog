Chess is one of the famous strategy board games in the world. It is also an ancient game. Chess has number of rules and techniques that may differ from various organizations to organization. But, the rules published  FIDE (Fédération Internationale des Échecs) or the International Federation of Chess are considered as the starndard.

  

However, there are lot more variants of chess games that were formed inspired by standard chess. Those are known Chess Variants. Some games use the same board and same set of pieces but different set of rules. Some games uses different type of boards and pieces. Like wise there are more than 2000 chess variants in the world. You can find more information about Chess Variants in [this Wikipedia Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chess_variants).

  

Inspired with Chess Variants, I too created a chess variant that is faster and fun. A normal standard chess game may take hours. But there are fast games like Bullet Chess. My chess variant is little bit different. I use the same standard chess board and pieces and slightly altered some rules. The winning factor of the this game is the Score. And, each player gets only 20 moves. After 20 moves, the game is over and the player who has the highest score wins. There are different ways score points. Following are the ways you can score points;

- Capturing pieces
- Pawn Promotion
- Checking the King
- Checkmate
- Opponent Time Out

In a standard chess game, Checkmate is considered as victory. But in ChessT20 it is considered as a way to end the game. At the end highest score wins. However, for checkmate, the player receive 50 points. [Please refer ChessT20 Rules here](https://www.buddhilive.com/p/chess-t20-rules.html).

  

If you are cricket fan, you know about Twenty Twenty version of cricket which is known as the fastes version of cricket. Chess T20 idea has the influence of T20 cricket. As in T20 cricket games, each team gets 20 overs to play, in ChessT20, each player gets 20 moves to play.

  

The game is currently in beta version and I'm keep experimenting on the game. I'm glad to announce you that I'm releasing the beta version of the game in an online platform for you to play and test. Currently you can play with the Chess AI and test the game. Soon, I'm planning to implement multiplayer version.
