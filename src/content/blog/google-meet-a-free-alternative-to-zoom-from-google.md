With COVID19 outbreak, we saw how video meetings become very important over past few months. Video conference products like Zoom recieved a huge popularity during this period. Apart from Zoom there are other video conference softwares. One such software is Google Meet, which is the premium video conference product from Google. Google Meet was available as a product of G Suit. Seeing the importance of video conference during this pandemic, the internet giant Google announced that they are making Google Meet available free for everyone!

  

Google Meet is a reliable product that has been used and trusted by schools, governments and enterprises around the world. Google Meet is bundled up with all the [important features](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/productivity-collaboration/introducing-tiled-view-and-other-top-requested-features-in-google-meet) including scheduling, screen sharing, different layouts plus real-time captioning (which is one of my personal favorites). Google Meet is available on [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.meetings&hl=en_US) and [Apps Stor](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1013231476)e as well.

  

Google Meet is designed, build and operate in a well secured environment. Because Google consider [privacy and security](https://support.google.com/meet/answer/9852160) are paramount in a video conference. Google states in their [official blog](https://www.blog.google/products/meet/bringing-google-meet-to-more-people/):

  

> Our approach to security is simple: make products safe by default. We designed Meet to operate on a secure foundation, providing the protections needed to keep our users safe, their data secure, and their information private.

  

Google Meet allows 100 participants per video conference while 60 minutes time limit for free version (40 minutes in Zoom). But, Google says, they won't enforce this time limit until 30th of September. This is to allow users to have smooth video conference experience in this pandemic period. Not only that, Google is planing to provide [G Suite Essential](https://gsuite.google.com/essentials/)s Free for everyone through 30th September. This will add more advanced features to Google Meet, such as dial-in phone numbers, larger meetings, and meeting recording.

  

Apart from those free features, Google Meet provides many more features for G Suite users. Anyway, the features that are available for free are more than enough for small businesses, schools and teams to work collaboratively during this pandemic times. Thanks Google for making your premium video conference product available for free in this times of need. Don't you think now it's the time to switch to Google Meet?
