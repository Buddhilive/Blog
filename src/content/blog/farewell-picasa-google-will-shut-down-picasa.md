Google have decided to shut down Picasa Web Albums and Picasa Software for Windows. Picasa for Windows will be ceased from March 15, 2016 while Picasa Web Albums will be terminate its services on May 1, 2016.

  

Google Photos Chief Anil Sabharwal state that Google have take this decision to focus entirely on Google Photos. So they can develop a single photo service with great features to match their customer requirements. [Google acquired Fly Labs](http://www.buddhilive.com/2015/11/google-acquires-fly-labs.html), a quick video editing app for iOS to integrate with Google Photos.

Picasa was acquired by Google in 2004 from Lifescape and the service didn't receive much attention from Google. Picasa never got the opportunity to enter the mobile world and finally the service will be ceased this year.
