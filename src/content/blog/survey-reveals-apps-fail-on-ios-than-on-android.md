A [survey done by BGR](http://bgr.com/2016/11/17/iphone-vs-android-reliability-crashing-apps/) reveals that applications on the iOS platform are much more unstable than those on Android devices. 😉

  

The survey indicates that 62% of iOS devices suffered a failure over the last three months compared with 47% of Android devices. 😏

  

Among the most unstable apps are Instagram and Snapchat on iOS, while the "Address Book" and "Google Play Services", which are part of the operating system, are the apps fail on Android. 😀
