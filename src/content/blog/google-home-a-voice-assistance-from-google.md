Google unveil a voice assistant during the Google I / O 2016 known as '[Google Home](https://home.google.com/)', developed to compete with Amazon Echo.

"Google Home is a voice-activated product that brings the Google assistant to any room in your house." said Sundar Pichai, CEO, Google. Simply Google Home is a "virtual assistant that responds to simple questions and performs basic tasks and will have a similar design to the [Google OnHub router](http://www.buddhilive.com/2015/09/google-onhub-wireless-router-from-google.html)."
