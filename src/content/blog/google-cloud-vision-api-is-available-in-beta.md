Google Cloud Vision API Â (a service that helps to build apps image recognition and classification features) is now available as public Beta.

  

Google Cloud API is actually the same technology Google use in Google Image search. This technology can recognize images and classify them seperately as animals, foods, people, places etc. Not only that, this service can flag inappropriate content too. For example if you want your app to show pictures of animals only, Google Cloud Vision API can do it easily.
