Private cloud is hosted and operated only within a organization, and it can be managed internally or by third party. Only users within the organization can access the system and services. Let's take a look what are the advantages and disadvatages of Private Cloud.  

## 

Advantages

2. More Control - Since private cloud is managed within an organization, it have more control on its resources and hardware.
3. Cost and Energy Efficiency - Although private cloud resources are not cost effective as public cloud, it is more efficient than public cloud.

2. Inflexible Prices - Organizations have to bare more cost to purchase new hardware when public cloud is expanding to fulfill the demand.
3. Limited Scalability - Scalability of private cloud is limited to the capacity of internal hosted resources.
