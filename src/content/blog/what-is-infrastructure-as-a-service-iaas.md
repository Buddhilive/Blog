But IaaS depends on your internet connection. If your internet connection fails, your business will be hault for a while. Customers must depend on limited customization options provided by IaaS platform vendors. If any failure occurs from the vendors side too will interrupt your business. The most important thing is IaaS vendors can access your sensitive data, study their security and privacy policies and make sure your sensitive data is secured with them. It is advisable to work with reliable companies like Google, Microsoft or Amazon.
