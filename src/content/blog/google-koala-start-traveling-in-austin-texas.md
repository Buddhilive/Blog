Google has started testing its self-driven car, “Koala Car” in the streets of Austin, Texas. In the previous week, we heard that [**Honda is also testing its self-driven car**](http://www.buddhilive.com/2015/09/honda-is-going-to-test-self-driven-car.html). So experiments are carried out by many companies to invent a perfect self-driven car. Google start testing its self-driven car first at Mountain View, California and unveiled it May, 2014. The car is built without steering wheels, pedal, mirrors etc which are the common accessories include in a normal car. Google announce the car to be fully functional in December, 2014.

The car has a speed of 40 km/h. However Google doesn’t wanna manufacture the car itself. Instead, they would join with famous automobile companies to manufacture its car when their self-driven car technology is improved and fully functional without any problem.
