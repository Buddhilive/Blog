According to sources of [Venture Beat](http://venturebeat.com/2016/08/24/inside-backstage-youtubes-plan-to-bring-photos-polls-and-text-to-the-video-service/) , Google had plans to turn YouTube into a social network that can post texts, images and polls to YouTube.

  

Google call this feature "Backstage" which can turn YouTube into a social network. This make YouTube eligible to compete directly with Facebook and Twitter.

  

"Backstage" allows YouTube users to share text, photos, video or polls - and updates will be displayed in reverse chronological order. Backstage also notify subscribers, when updates are posted. Backstage is expected to launch by the end of this year.
