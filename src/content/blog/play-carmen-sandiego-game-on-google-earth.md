"[Carmen Sandiego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmen_Sandiego)" is a series of American educational mystery video games which was released in 1985. The classic game which was played by several generations, can now be found in Google Earth. 

  

Google introduced (on March 13, 2019) "The Crown Jewel Robbery", the first in a series of Carmen Sandiego games on Google Earth.

  

The game was created in collaboration with Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, who are the original publishers of Carmen Sandiego games.

  

Google says in [their blog post](https://www.blog.google/products/earth/your-mission-gumshoe-catch-carmen-sandiego-google-earth/) "our game is an homage to the original. It’s for all those gumshoes who grew up with the chase, and for the next generation feeling that geography itch for the first time."
