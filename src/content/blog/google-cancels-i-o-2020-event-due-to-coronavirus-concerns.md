Google cancels it's largest event, the Google I/O 2020 due to growing concerns of COVID-19. The tech giant has made this decision as many other global events like MWC Barcelona are been canceled so far.

  
In their official [website](https://events.google.com/io/), Google has stated as follows:  
  

> Due to concerns around the coronavirus (COVID-19), and in accordance with health guidance from the CDC, WHO, and other health authorities, we have decided to cancel the physical Google I/O event at Shoreline Amphitheatre.  
> All guests who have purchased tickets to I/O 2020 will receive a full refund by March 13, 2020. If you don’t see the credit on your statement by then, please reach out to io@google.com. Guests who have registered for I/O 2020 will not need to enter next year’s drawing and will be automatically granted the option of purchasing an I/O 2021 ticket.  
> Over the coming weeks, we will explore other ways to evolve Google I/O to best connect with our developer community.

  
Meanwhile, there's a news that an employee from Google Zurich office has been confirmed Coronavirus positive. A Google spokesman has stated about this;  
  

>  We can confirm that an employee at the Zurich office was diagnosed with the coronavirus. He stayed in the Zurich office for a limited time, before showing any symptoms. We take - and will continue to take - all necessary precautionary measures, following the advice of public health authorities, as we prioritize the health and safety of everyone.
