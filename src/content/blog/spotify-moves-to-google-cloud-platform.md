Spotify is a popular Swedish commercial music streaming, podcast and video service announced that they are moving to Google Cloud Platform. Engineering and Infrastructure vice president of Spotify wrote a [blog post](https://news.spotify.com/us/2016/02/23/announcing-spotify-infrastructures-googley-future/) saying "Good infrastructure isn't just about keeping things up and running, it's about making all of our teams more efficient and more effective, and Google's data stack does that for us in spades. Google has long been a thought-leader in this space, and this shows in the sophistication and quality of its data offerings. From traditional batch processing with Dataproc, to rock-solid event delivery with Pub/Sub to the nearly magical abilities of BigQuery, building on Google's data infrastructure provides us with a significant advantage where it matters the most."

  

Spotify will implement Google Cloud Datastore, Google Cloud Bigtable, Google Cloud Networking services like Direct Peering, Cloud VPN, and Cloud Router. This is another big deal for Google Cloud Platform.
